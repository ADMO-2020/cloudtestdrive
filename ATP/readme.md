# Autonomous Transaction Processing for Developers #



## Lab Introduction ##

In this hands-on lab you will get first-hand experience with Oracleâ€™s new Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) service. Oracle ATP delivers a self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database service that can instantly scale to meet demands of mission critical transaction processing and mixed workload applications.

Your instructor will provide you a URL that allows to perform **Self Registration**, where you will be asked to provide a username and a password of your choosing.  **Please note down this username and password, you will need this info later in the labs!**
       

- **USING A PERSONAL TRIAL ACCOUNT ?** 

  In case you are using a personal Cloud Trial Account, you will need to prepare your Cloud Environment to be able to execute these labs.  See [instructions on this page](../AppDev/ATP-OKE/README.md) for all details.

  



## Lab Instructions ##


This section will take you through the steps to set up a CI/CD environment for developing Microservices, based on the automation possible in Developer Cloud and deploying all components on Oracle's Managed Container platform.
