Below you find the instructions for installing Data Visualization Desktop.
Note that the lab can be executed using either Oracle Analytics Cloud or Data Visualization Desktop. So if you already have an OAC instance, feel free to use that instead.

# Install Data Visualization Desktop

1. Download DVD by clicking [here](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/oracle-data-visualization-desktop.html#) and follow the instructions. 
2. Install DVD locally on your computer. 
3. The Machine Learning in DVD relies on open source packages that are -not- installed by default. To install these packages, go to the Windows Start menu, browse to Oracle (or type "install DVML") and click Install DVML. (This will install the advanced analytics option needed for this lab)
4. The installer starts on completion of the download. Follow the displayed instructions to install machine learning to the selected install path.
5. Click Finish to close the installer. When prompted, press any key to close the terminal window. If Oracle Analytics Desktop was running during the installation, then restart it.  

When done, return to the lab.
